ASSIGNMENT

Instructions

·         The point of this exercise is to give a small sample approach to writing code. I didn't try and second-guess what we might want to see - I wrote what I consider to be a straightforward, elegant, solution to this problem.

·         I included tests to demonstrate the validity and correctness of your code.

***Electronic cash card***

Design a software implementation in Java for an electronic pre-paid cash card which allows:

·         Loading money onto the card.

·         Spending credit balances from the card.

·         Using the card simultaneously at multiple retailers.
